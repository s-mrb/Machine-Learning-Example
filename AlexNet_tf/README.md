**About:**
Simple, beginner level, implementation of AlexNet (PCA is not implemented in this notebook for the sake of simplicity, whereas was used in AlexNet)



**Val Accuracy:**
```
~86.9 in 141 epochs on Intel Scene Classification Dataset
~87   in >220 epochs on Imagenette subset curated by Fast AI (Full Size version)



Comparison with some best models made on these datasets:

Best Scene Classification Dataset accuracy using Transfer Learning using ResNet, and a lot more pre processing then done in this notebook is ~96 (Intel Image classification Challenge winner)


Best Imagenette Dataset accuracy using Transfer Learning using xResNet50, and a lot more pre processing then done in this notebook is ~95 (on FastAI LeaderBoard)


Transfer Learning model valid accuracy reaches 90 in 2 epochs.
